------------------------------------------------
✅ Week 1: Initial Setup & Vulnerability Testing
------------------------------------------------
☑️ Application setup and deployment (http://localhost:3000)
☑️ Reviewed user functions: signup, login, profile

☑️ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test:
   → Injected <script>alert('XSS');</script>
   → ✅ Vulnerable (alert displayed)

☑️ SQL Injection Test:
   → Used input: admin' OR '1'='1
   → ✅ Login bypassed

☑️ Automated Vulnerability Scan (OWASP ZAP):
   → Found insecure headers, missing input validation, plain-text password storage

☑️ Weak password handling confirmed (no encryption)

------------------------------------------------
✅ Week 2: Implemented Security Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
☑️ Input Validation:
   → Used validator.js to sanitize all inputs

☑️ Password Hashing:
   → Applied bcrypt hashing with salting

☑️ Token-Based Authentication:
   → Integrated JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless sessions

☑️ HTTP Security Headers:
   → Added Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.

☑️ Post-Testing:
   → XSS & SQL Injection attacks failed
   → Core features (signup/login) worked normally

------------------------------------------------
✅ Week 3: Advanced Security & Final Review
------------------------------------------------
☑️ Penetration Testing:
   → Used Nmap to scan localhost
   → ✅ No unexpected open ports found

☑️ Logging:
   → Integrated Winston logger
   → Captures auth attempts and errors

☑️ Final Security Checklist:
   ☐ Input validation  
   ☐ Secure password hashing  
   ☐ HTTPS enabled  
   ☐ Proper logging  
   ☐ Use of security headers  
   ☐ Token-based authentication  

☑️ Final Application Testing:
   → All known attacks blocked (XSS, SQLi)
   → HTTPS and headers active
   → Data encrypted
   → Authentication secure and logged
